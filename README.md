### Project Description
This project is a simple react front-end project that uses a ruby on rails REST API to fecth doctors, patients and their appointments. 

The REACT Application allows doctors to login and view the patients that have booked appointments with them. They can also choose to take up the appointment, reschedule the appointment or even cancel the entire appointment. The doctor can also have a view of the patients medical records.

The application also allows patients to sign up and login in to be able to access the application. Here the patient can see a list of doctors and book an appointment. They can concurrently make changes to their appointment or even cancel their appointment all together.

The API allows managementof the doctors, patients, appointments and their medical records. The application has 4 models, patient, doctor, appointment, medical records. 

The API has a many to many relationship where many patients can belong to many doctors and vice versa.
It also has a has one relationship where a patient only has one medical record. 
It has a one to many relationship where a patient can have many appointments.
The API provides several RESTful routes that allow users to view, create, update and delete appointments, medical records, patients and doctors.

### Features 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
